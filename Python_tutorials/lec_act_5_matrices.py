# Make a "picture" by drawing multiple copies of an object using matrices to move/scale/rotate the object
#
# Requirements:
#  1) Must include at least one for loop OR
#  2) Multiple uses of rotations/translations
#  3) At least one compound transformation (eg, a scale and a translation)
#
# Given to you:
#  functions to make matrices of the three different types
#  Plotting code
#  Read/write "objects" code
#  A square and a wedge and a star object
#
# Optional:
#  You can use the function make_object_by_clicking in object_routines to make a novel object (run object_routines.py)
#  make sure to include that object's file when you hand in
