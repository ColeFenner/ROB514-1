# -------------------------- Optimization -------------------------------
#
#  There are many engineering problems that can be expressed as an optimization of parameters to minimize/maximize some
# function. Cute trick: You can turn any maximization problem into a minimization one by multiplying by -1...
#   For example, what angle should you put the wind turbine blades if the wind is blowing at 30 mph if you
# want to maximize energy output? This assumes you have some function/simulation you can run that will output the
# amount of energy produced given the angle and the wind speed. Then it's a "search" for the angle that maximizes the
# energy produced. The simplest form of search is gradient descent.
#
# In this tutorial we'll focus on the mechanics of setting up the search using a quadratic function (find x given f(x))
#  and a 2D parameter search (find x,y given f(x,y)). The f is just a generic function that you could solve for
#  analytically; but pretend it's some complicated bit of code that simulates some system.

# A generic function that we want to find the minimum of
def my_func(x):
    """A quadratic function
    @param x the input x value
    @returns f(x)"""
